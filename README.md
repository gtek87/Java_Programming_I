# Java Programming I - Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for the "Java Programming I" course on MOOC.fi. This repository contains my solutions and exercises completed during the seven parts of the course.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into seven parts, each focusing on different aspects of programming. Here's a brief overview of each part:

### Part 1: Getting Started
Welcome to learning programming! This part focuses on taking the plunge into programming and becoming familiar with the essential tools.

### Part 2: Repetition and Functionality
The second part emphasizes repetition in programs and how to divide functionality into distinct units.

### Part 3: List and Array Manipulation
In the third part, the main themes revolve around adding information to list and array data structures, and handling information in string form.

### Part 4: Object-Oriented Programming
The fourth part delves into object-oriented programming, covering reading data from files and representing information with the help of objects.

### Part 5: Continuing OOP
The fifth part continues with object-oriented programming, building upon the concepts introduced in the fourth part.

### Part 6: Objects Composition
The sixth part handles objects consisting of objects, exploring the separation of the text user interface and the program logic.

### Part 7: Programming Paradigms and Algorithms
In the seventh part, the focus shifts to general programming paradigms and algorithms. The Introduction to Programming (TKT-10002) course concludes after the seventh week, leading to the start of the Advanced course in programming (TKT-10003) with the eighth part.
